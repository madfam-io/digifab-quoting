# COTIZA STUDIO: THREE-YEAR STRATEGIC GROWTH PLAN
## The Manufacturing Revolution Platform

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Cotiza Studio will become the **"Bloomberg Terminal for Digital Manufacturing"** - the definitive pricing intelligence and procurement platform for the $12 trillion global manufacturing market. Starting from our beachhead in Mexico's $450B manufacturing sector, we'll expand to become the trusted source-of-truth for manufacturing costs, connecting 10 million makers with 500,000 suppliers globally by Year 3.

**The Opportunity**: Manufacturing pricing remains opaque, inefficient, and relationship-dependent. We're digitizing this $100B annual quoting market, saving businesses 40% on procurement costs while giving suppliers qualified, high-intent leads.

**Our Moat**: Network effects + proprietary pricing data + AI-powered DFM engine = an unassailable competitive position.
