# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - MADFAM Quoting MVP

## Your setup is ready! Here's how to test the app:

### 1. Start the Application

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait for the services to start (about 30 seconds). You'll see output from multiple services.

### 2. Access the Applications

Open these URLs in your browser:

- **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:4000/api/docs

### 3. Login Credentials

Use these accounts to test:

**Admin Account** (full access):

- Email: `admin@madfam.io`
- Password: `admin123`

**Customer Account** (limited access):

- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `test123`

### 4. Test the Quote Flow

1. **Login** with the admin account
2. **Upload a file** - You can use any STL, STEP, or DXF file
3. **Select service** - Choose 3D Printing (FFF), SLA, CNC, or Laser Cutting
4. **Choose material** - Options will appear based on selected service
5. **Set quantity** and options
6. **Create quote** - System will calculate pricing
7. **View quote** - See the detailed quote with pricing breakdown

### 5. Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

**Port already in use error:**

```bash
# Kill processes on ports
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9
```

**Database connection error:**

```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker-compose ps

# Restart services if needed
docker-compose restart
```

**Can't login:**

```bash
# Re-run the seed script
cd apps/api
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
cd ../..
```

### 6. Stop the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop all services.

To stop Docker services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## What's Working

âœ… Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation
âœ… Authentication with JWT tokens
âœ… Role-based access control (Admin, Customer)
âœ… File upload with S3 presigned URLs (mocked locally)
âœ… Quote creation with pricing calculation
âœ… Material and machine management
âœ… Audit logging for all operations
âœ… Redis caching for performance
âœ… Comprehensive API documentation

## Next Steps

- Try uploading different file types
- Test different materials and quantities
- Check the API documentation at http://localhost:4000/api/docs
- View audit logs (admin only)
- Test the quote acceptance flow
