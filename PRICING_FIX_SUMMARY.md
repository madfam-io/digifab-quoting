# Pricing Fix Summary

## Critical Issue Fixed
The hardcoded $100 pricing in the quote calculation service has been replaced with proper integration of the pricing engine.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `QuoteCalculationService` (`apps/api/src/modules/quotes/services/quote-calculation.service.ts`)
- Added imports for `PricingEngine`, `TenantPricingConfig`, and related types from `@madfam/pricing-engine`
- Injected `CacheService` dependency
- Created `PricingEngine` instance in constructor
- Replaced hardcoded pricing logic in `calculateItemPricing` method with calls to the pricing engine
- Implemented `extractGeometry` method to convert DFM report data to pricing engine format
- Implemented `getCachedTenantConfig` and `parseTenantConfig` methods for tenant-specific pricing configuration
- Updated type signatures to handle proper pricing result structure

### 2. Updated `PricingService` (`apps/api/src/modules/pricing/pricing.service.ts`)
- Added imports for `PricingEngine` and related types from `@madfam/pricing-engine`
- Created `PricingEngine` instance in constructor
- Replaced hardcoded pricing logic in `calculateQuoteItem` method with calls to the pricing engine
- Added proper conversion of tenant configuration to pricing engine format
- Integrated pricing engine results with proper error handling

## Key Implementation Details

### Pricing Engine Integration
```typescript
// Instead of hardcoded:
const pricingResult = {
  unitPrice: 100,
  totalPrice: 100 * item.quantity,
  leadTime: 5,
  margin: 0.3,
};

// Now using pricing engine:
const pricingResult = this.pricingEngine.calculate({
  process: item.process as ProcessType,
  geometry: this.extractGeometry(item),
  material: material as Material,
  machine: machine as Machine,
  selections: item.selections,
  quantity: item.quantity,
  tenantConfig: await this.getCachedTenantConfig(tenantId),
});
```

### Tenant Configuration
The pricing engine now uses tenant-specific configuration including:
- Margin floor and target percentages
- Overhead rates
- Energy tariffs
- Labor rates
- Rush order upcharges
- Volume discounts
- Sustainability factors

### Error Handling
- Proper validation of inputs before pricing calculation
- Warnings are collected and returned with the pricing result
- Failed calculations return appropriate error messages

## Testing
While formal tests couldn't be run due to configuration issues, the implementation:
1. Removes all hardcoded $100 pricing
2. Properly integrates the existing pricing engine package
3. Uses tenant-specific configuration
4. Handles all process types (FFF, SLA, CNC, Laser)
5. Includes proper cost breakdown and sustainability metrics

## Next Steps
1. Ensure all required fields are properly populated in the database (materials, machines, tenant settings)
2. Add proper unit tests once the test configuration is fixed
3. Verify pricing calculations with real-world test data
4. Monitor for any missing properties in the pricing engine calculators (e.g., machine.powerW)
